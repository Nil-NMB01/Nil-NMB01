<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Key Projects and Contributions:</h2>
- <b>Logboek Dataverwerkingen Standard (inspired by OpenTelemetry)</b>
  
  - [Repository](https://github.com/Logius-standaarden/logboek-dataverwerkingen) ‚Äì Led the development of a logging standard based on [GDPR](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-basics/the-gdpr-in-brief), providing real-time transparency for data mutations.  This is potentially impacting millions of citizens and organizations with real-time transparency in their data mutations by the government.

***An example of the LDV standard in action: an overview in MijnOverheid, with which a citizen gains insight into the data processing of their data by the government. This implementation serves as an example and is not definitive. See [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/digilab.overheid.nl/ecosystem/logboek-dataverwerkingen/ldv-referentie-implementatie/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for your own development setup and the source code.***

  - [Repository](https://github.com/Logius-standaarden/logboek-dataverwerkingen) ‚Äì Mainly developed the Logboek Dataverwerkingen Extension Guidelines with a colleague, to make sure organizations can build own extensions on the core standard in case the core standard does not provide enough functionalities. Think about organizations in the healthcare sector for example who have to log more strictly due to healthcare norms such as the [NEN 7513](https://www.nen.nl/nen-7513-2024-nl-329182).

- <b>API Standards and Guidelines</b>

  - [Digikoppeling (DK) Security standards & regulations](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/Digikoppeling-Beveiligingsstandaarden-en-voorschriften/) ‚Äì Contributed to the Digikoppeling security standard & regulations. Digikoppeling is the obligatory national standard in context of data exchange that every Dutch government has to follow when doing any kind of data exchange with fellow governments or citizens and companies. My role was analyzing and updating the security measures, such as compliance with high security protocols like TLS 1.2/1.3 conform the advice of national security organizations such as the [National Cyber Security Centre of the Netherlands](https://www.ncsc.nl/) (NCSC). Some of the advice measures were also based on guidelines from the NCSC, such as the [2025 Security guidelines](https://www.ncsc.nl/documenten/publicaties/2025/juni/01/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-2025-05).

  - [Federative Service Connectivity (FSC) Extension Guidelines](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/fsc-extensie-template/) ‚Äì Developed the Extension Guidelines for the Digikoppeling Federative Service Connectivity standard to make sure organizations can build own extensions on the core standard in case the core standard does not provide enough functionalities.

- <b>Collaborative Projects</b>

  - [Logius Tech Radar](https://github.com/Logius-standaarden/tech-radar) ‚Äì Contributed and collaborated on the development of the Logius Tech Radar to follow interesting development for data exchange standards to potentially monitor.
